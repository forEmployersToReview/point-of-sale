## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need npm or yarn to install any necessary packages.


### Installing
1st: Clone the github repo by running `git clone https://github.com/Elifaz/point-of-sale.git`
2nd: run `npm install && npm start` from the root directory of the cloned repo to start the application on port 3000.

## API
There is no .env configuration necessary for this app.
The API key used in here is already available within the file where it's being used.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* [GprahQL](http://graphql.org/) - GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.
* [Apollo]() - Apollo provides a universal GraphQL API on top of your existing services, so you can build new application features fast without waiting on backend changes.


GraphQL specification was new for me, I took the weekend to learn so I could finish the application. Very interesting idea.

Although [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) was the suggested framework, I decided to go with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for this assignment.

Thank you!! 
It was fun
